airbnb- but with bitcoin

The second project of the Bootcamp, this was a fun idea to pursue - provide a site like AirBnB, but exclusively using bitcoin for payments. 

My responsibilities here involved primarily two fields - the site organization and the user interface. There were four on the team. One was responsible for the bitcoin idea and interface, one did database and server side work, one did the credential authorization work, which included the modals. The rest of the HTML and CSS were mine, along with some contributions on the server side.

A lot of time went into this one. I did use my REALTOR background to come up with the home photos to seed the database. It was a good project for broadening experience and maintaining communication while working apart.
